# Air Blimp
Sources, code, and files for the Air Blimp project

This code is implemented as a Bluetooth app. 
A helium balloon will keep the blimp suspended in air. This Bluetooth app will have access to the vector thrusters on either side, and when signified, these will steer the blimp in the desired direction.
